Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream

Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read

Write a function that returns the length of a string.
3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
mandatory

Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes

7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half

Prototype: char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers
#advanced
Write a function that convert a string to an integer.

Prototype: int _atoi(char *s);
The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters
You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number
If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0
You are not allowed to use long
You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array
You are not allowed to hard-code special values
We will use the -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag to compile your code.
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: atoi. Run man atoi to learn more.
11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code
#advanced
Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.

You are allowed to use the standard library
You don’t have to pass the betty-style tests (you still need to pass the betty-doc tests)
